# 💎 Diamond Price Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict **diamond prices** based on key attributes such as **carat, cut, color, clarity, and depth**. Using **Machine Learning models**, we analyze and forecast diamond pricing trends, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.  

## 🔍 Key Features  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand key pricing factors  
✅ **Feature Engineering** to enhance model performance  
✅ Implemented **Multiple Regression Models** (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
✅ Evaluated model performance using **R-squared, RMSE, and MAE**  
✅ **Interactive Interface** for user-friendly price predictions  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Algorithms Used:** Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset contains various features of diamonds, including:  
- **Carat:** Weight of the diamond  
- **Cut:** Quality of the cut (*Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal*)  
- **Color:** Diamond color grading (*D - J*)  
- **Clarity:** Purity of the diamond (*IF, VVS1, VVS2, VS1, etc.*)  
- **Depth & Table:** Proportions of the diamond
